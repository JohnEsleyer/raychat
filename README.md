# raychat

This project is a demonstration of how to integrate Firebase Firestore with Flutter by building a simple chat app with a single chat room that all users can join. The app allows users to send and receive messages in real-time, with support for both text and images. Users can create accounts, sign in, and join the chat room to start chatting with other users. The app's backend is powered by Firebase Firestore, which provides a reliable and scalable cloud database for real-time data synchronization. The UI is built using Flutter, which enables a fast and responsive user experience across both Android and iOS devices. This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn how to use Firebase Firestore with Flutter to build real-time apps.
